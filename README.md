[Secondary School Project]</br>
This project was one of  my  Retho TFE</br>
It consist of a shopping site for saxophone products and it was made out of php.</br>
I think this project just shows me all the knowledge i've acquired during the Helmo School</br>
For me it's a throwback of when I was developping on my own, I think I wasn't that bad but I had no structure.</br>
Unfortunatly i can't find my php project done at Helmo, it was way better structured.
